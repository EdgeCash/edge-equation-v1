"""
MLB Splits + Handedness + Statcast xStats Loader. EXPERIMENTAL.
================================================================
Reads per-season splits.json, the people.json handedness lookup, and
the Statcast statcast_xstats.json expected-stats leaderboards into a
single object that the props backtest can query for handedness-aware
projection rates.

No-look-ahead by construction: this loader only ever returns
PRIOR-season data when asked about season N. So projecting a 2024
game uses only 2023 splits and 2023 xStats — both genuinely available
in real time the morning of every 2024 game.

For the earliest backfilled season (where prior is missing), every
lookup returns None and the caller falls back to the running-aggregate
rate it would've used pre-feature.

Sample threshold:
  - Splits: ignore below 30 PA / batters-faced.
  - Statcast xStats: ignore below 100 PA (to keep noise out of expected
    rates). xStats fall back to actual AVG/SLG from the same season
    above this threshold isn't met, since AVG/SLG aren't expected
    estimates and don't suffer the same small-sample noise.

Decision tree the projector uses for hitter AVG (and analogously SLG):
  1. Prior-season vL/vR AVG (handedness-specific) — most matchup-aware
  2. Prior-season xBA (aggregate, expected) — best aggregate estimator
  3. Running current-season AVG (running aggregate) — what we had pre-features
  4. League average (last-resort fallback inside the projector itself)

Usage:
    loader = SplitsLoader(backfill_dir)
    pitch_hand = loader.pitch_hand(player_id)            # 'L' | 'R' | None
    bat_side = loader.effective_bat_side(player_id, opp_pitch_hand)
    avg = loader.hitter_avg_vs(player_id, season, opp_pitch_hand)
    slg = loader.hitter_slg_vs(player_id, season, opp_pitch_hand)
    xba = loader.hitter_xba(player_id, season)
    xslg = loader.hitter_xslg(player_id, season)
    baa = loader.pitcher_baa_vs(player_id, season, opp_bat_side)
    k_per_pa = loader.pitcher_k_per_pa_vs(player_id, season, opp_bat_side)

All numeric methods return float | None — None if the prior season
has no usable sample for that player.
