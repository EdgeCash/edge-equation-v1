/**
 * Copy the data pipeline's outputs into the Next.js public/ tree so they're
 * served at /data/{mlb,wnba}/* in the deployed site.
 *
 * The cron writes to website/public/data/{mlb,wnba}/ (inside v1's
 * legacy Pages-router site, where the data has lived since PR #146).
 * Vercel's Root Directory for THIS site is web/, which only sees files
 * inside web/, so we copy on each build.
 *
 * Side note: this also means Vercel rebuilds (which happen on every
 * commit to main, including the daily data commits) automatically pick
 * up fresh data — no manual trigger needed.
 *
 * Run as a pre-step to `next dev` and `next build` (see package.json).
 * Safe to run when the source dir doesn't exist (just logs and exits 0).
